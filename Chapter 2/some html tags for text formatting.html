    <h2>Freedon Fighter game info</h2>
    <p><strong>Video cards</strong> that use the 3DFX chip (Voodoo brand etc.) no longer have driver support for DirectX libraries 8 and above. As Freedom Fighters requires DirectX8.1 or higher and Hardware T&L these video cards are not supported. 

        Due to varying technology, features and driver versions of video cards for <em>laptops</em>, we cannot guarantee that this game will be compatible with laptop systems.
        
        If you are experiencing <del>graphical</del> or sound problems please make sure you have the latest drivers for your hardware installed. These can be downloaded from your hardware manufacturers website or may be obtained from the hardware manufacturerâ€™s Technical Support hotline.</p>
    <p><mark>Windows XP</mark> has a feature called Fast User Switching; this allows multiple users sharing the same computer to have individual profiles and to swap their current work spaces without logging off. Freedom Fighters does not support this feature and it is not accessable during gameplay.
